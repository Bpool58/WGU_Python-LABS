Instructor note:
The skills required for this lab are covered in Chapter 3 - Variables and Expressions. 
To successfully complete this lab, review the content of Chapter 3 and complete the Challenge Activities associated.

Given four values representing counts of quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies,
 output the total amount as dollars and cents.

Output each floating-point value with two digits after the decimal point, 
which can be achieved as follows:
print(f'Amount: ${dollars:.2f}')

Ex: If the input is:

4
3
2
1
where 4 is the number of quarters, 3 is the number of dimes,
 2 is the number of nickels, and 1 is the number of pennies, the output is:
Amount: $1.41
For simplicity, assume input is non-negative.......
